## Overview

1. Machine Setup
https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/01-machine-setup/MACHINE-SETUP.md

1. Project Initialization
- Either Copy an existing project of create a new on from scratch (choose 1)
     - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/02-project-initialization/01a-copy-existing-repo-in-github.md
     - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/02-project-initialization/01b-create-repo-in-github.md

- Clone repo to local.md
   - ALWAYS Use Git to clone the new repository to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/youraccount/yourrepo
```
   - File > Preferences > Settings > Search 'terminal.integrated.cwd' > update file pathway

- If starting from scratch only : Add key files such as .gitignore and requirements.txt
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/02-project-initialization/03-add-gitignore-and-requirements.md
  - Create a new file in your root repo folder named exactly: .gitignore IMPORTANT: Spelling, capitalization, and name are critical. If the name or location is not exact, it will not work. Find the .gitignore file in the root of this pro-analytics-01 repo and paste the entire contents into your .gitignore file. This is a good starting point for many Python projects. Actual .gitignore contents will vary by project.
  - Create a new file in your root project folder named exactly: requirements.txt. IMPORTANT: Spelling, capitalization, and name are critical. If the name or location is not exact, the commands we provide will not work. Find the requirements.txt file in the root of this pro-analytics-01 repo and paste the entire contents into your requirements.txtfile. This is a good starting point for many Python projects. Actual requirements.txt contents will vary by project.

- If starting from scratch only: Use Git to add, commit, and push your new files to GitHub:
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/02-project-initialization/04-git-add-commit-push.md
```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m "Add .gitignore and requirements.txt files"
```
```
git push -u origin main
```
- ALWAYS create a python virtual environment for your project:
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/02-project-initialization/05-create-virtual-environment.md
```
py -m venv .venv
```

3. Repeatable Project Workflow
- Pull Changes
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/03-repeatable-workflow/01-git-pull-before-changes.md
```
git pull origin 
```

- Activate Virtual Environment
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/03-repeatable-workflow/02-activate-virtual-environment.md
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.5
```
cmd.exe
```
```
pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
```

- Install Dependencies
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/03-repeatable-workflow/03-install-dependencies.md
```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```
```
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run Scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/03-repeatable-workflow/04a-activate-and-run-python-script.md
    - Ctrl+Shift+P
    - Python: Select Interpreter
    - Choose an Interpreter - Look for the recommended local .venv option.
    - Activate and Execute
```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```
```
py myfile.py
```

- https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/03-repeatable-workflow/04b-activate-and-run-jupyter-notebook.md
    - Open the project notebook in VS Code. The file will have a .ipynb extension.
    - If prompted, select a Python interpreter that corresponds to your .venv.
    - If not prompted, click the kernel selector in the top-right corner of the notebook editor and choose the interpreter associated with your Python Environment / .venv.
    - Or:
    - From VS Code Menu, select View / Command Palette... (CTRL SHIFT P)
    - Type: Python: Select Interpreter
    - Choose your .venv from the list

- Modify Code and test
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/03-repeatable-workflow/05-modify-and-test.md

- Save
  - https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/blob/main/03-repeatable-workflow/06-git-add-commit-push.md
```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m "Add .gitignore and requirements.txt files"
```
```
git push -u origin main
```

6. Insights
Both the SciPy and scikit-learn models predicted very similar outcomes:
- Scipy: 38.59
- scikit-learn: 38.94

These results make sense as both are comparing the same dataset.

And both models support both conceptually and visually a gradual warming of January tempeartures over time which could be a result of global warming effects.

This also seems like a strong base and could easily be added to for more complex analysis.
